# React State Management Counter App

## 📖 Project Description

This project series demonstrates **different approaches to state management** in React applications by building an interactive **counter application**.

Starting with React’s built-in **`useState` hook**, we progressively implement more sophisticated state management solutions including **Context API** and **Redux**.

The goal is to showcase how to:

- Share state across multiple components
- Maintain application-wide data consistency
- Compare state management approaches in real-world scenarios

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these projects, you will:

- ✅ Understand fundamental React state management using `useState`
- ✅ Learn to implement global state management with **Context API**
- ✅ Master **Redux** for complex state scenarios
- ✅ Compare different state management solutions
- ✅ Implement **state persistence** across components
- ✅ Understand the concept of a **single source of truth**
- ✅ Structure applications for **scalable state management**

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **React** (v18 or later)
- **TypeScript**
- **Next.js** framework
- **Redux Toolkit** (for Redux implementation)
- **React-Redux** bindings

### Development Environment

- Code editor (💡 VS Code recommended)
- Terminal / Command line access
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)

---

## 🛠 Best Practices

### General React Practices

- **Component Organization**: Keep components small and focused
- **Type Safety**: Utilize TypeScript for type checking
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep state management logic separate from UI
- **Immutability**: Always treat state as immutable
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component/file should do one thing well

### Context API

- Create **context providers** at the right level in the tree
- Use **custom hooks** for context consumption
- Provide **TypeScript interfaces** for context values

### Redux

- Follow **Redux Toolkit** patterns
- Use **slices** for modular state management
- Type your **store, actions, and selectors**
- Create **typed hooks** for dispatch and selector usage

### Performance

- Memoize selectors when necessary
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders with precise state selection
- Use **Redux middleware** for complex side effects

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

By the end of the project, you will have:

1. A working **counter app** with three different implementations:
   - **useState**
   - **Context API**
   - **Redux**
2. Clear understanding of **when to use each solution**
3. Hands-on practice with **modern React state patterns**
4. A solid foundation for building more **complex stateful apps**
5. Confidence to **choose the right state management tool** for your projects
